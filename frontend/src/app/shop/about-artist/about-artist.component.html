        <h2>A Life Shaped by Grain</h2>
        <p>
          Silas Thorne didn't choose wood carving; it chose him. Growing up in the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest, 
          Silas spent his childhood surrounded by the scent of pine and the whispering of cedar. His grandfather, 
          a master craftsman himself, handed Silas his first chisel at the age of seven. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wood is a living history," Silas often says. "Every knot, every swirl in the grain tells a story of a 
          season survived, a storm weathered. My job is simply to listen and bring that story to the surface."

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
          Each piece Silas creates begins with a walk through the forest. He primarily works with fallen timber, 
          believing that the most beautiful art comes from giving new life to what nature has let go. 
          His process is slow, deliberate, and entirely by hand. 
        </p>
        <p>
          From the initial rough-out to the final delicate sanding, a single sculpture can take anywhere from 
          twenty to over a hundred hours. Silas uses traditional techniques, avoiding power tools to maintain 
          the soul of the wood.

        <h2>Commitment to Sustainability</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond the art, Silas is a fierce advocate for forest conservation. A portion of every sale is donated 
          to reforestation projects in the Northwest. By purchasing a piece of Silas's work, you're not just 
          owning a sculpture; you're supporting the preservation of the ancient woods that inspired it.
